# The Literal Calculator

A fun Rust + egui app that **literally counts on fingers and toes** to add numbers.  
Instead of showing the result instantly, it animates counting step by step with visuals and sounds.

## Features

- Animated finger & toe counting  
- Audio playback for each number  
- Funny error if the sum is too big  

## Run it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator_app.git
cd calculator_app
cargo run
